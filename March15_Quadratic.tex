Title : Solve $3x^2+2=0$ for $ x$?

Here is the full question:

> $ f(x) = x^3 + 2Î»x $ where $\lambda $ is a real parameter. <br>

> Find its stationary point(s) and discuss the nature of the stationary point(s), in the case where $\lambda > 0$, $\lambda  = 0$, and $\lambda < 0$.

I tried to solve $3x^2 + 2 = 0$ for $x$, but I can only get $\sqrt{-\frac 23}$ as a root.

So I don't know how to find stationary points of $f$.

\section{My Solution}
You would get complex numbers:
$$x=\pm\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}i$$
