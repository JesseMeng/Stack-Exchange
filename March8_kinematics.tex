Title : Finding average speed knowing acceleration

Particle, initially at rest travels in a straight line and its acceleration satisfies $$a=0.1(t-5)^2 $$for $0\leq t\leq5$

Find its average speed. during the first$5$ seconds.

I don't expect answers as this clearly is a homework, just a hint what formulas to use to find the answer. Initially I thought that it is $$\frac{\text{final velocity-initial velocity}}{2}$$
but my answer and books answer is different.
\section{My Solution}
Velocity is different from speed. For average speed, you'll need to use the equation of $\frac{d}{\Delta t}$. Where d is the sum of all the absolute displacements (also the total distance travelled). So, the hint here is likely you'll need to consider cases since positive and negative displacement shouldn't cancel out each other as they both contribute to the distance.
