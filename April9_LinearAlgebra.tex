Title : Intersection between line passing through 2 points and line passing through a point in the direction

I am stuck on this question during my exam review:

Let L1 be the line passing through $$P(-1,3,-2), Q=(5,-3,10).$$  Let L2 be the line passing through $$(4,0,3)$$ in the direction of $$v=
    \begin{bmatrix}
    3\\
    -1\\
    1\\
    \end{bmatrix}.
$$
Do the lines intersect?  If so, find their point of intersection.

Attempt:
I first found the normal vector of L1, which equals **n**=(6,-6,12).  Then, using the coordinates from P, I created a system of equations as follows: $$-1+6t = 4+3s$$

$$-3-6t=-s$$

$$-2+12t=3+s$$

and found that they do not intersect.  Is this correct? 
\section{My Solution}
Yes, your answer and your system of equations is correct. However, a line has infinitely many normal vectors in $R^3$, you meant $(6,-6,12)$ is the directional vector of $L1$.
