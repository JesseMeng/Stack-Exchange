Title : Proving a sequence by induction

Trying to prove by induction in a non-math course and I feel like I'm getting the steps but I'm just stuck on the math. 

$$G_1 = 1$$

$$G_2 = 1$$

$$G_n = 2G_{n−1} + 3G_{n−2}, \quad n \geq 3$$

Using mathematical induction, prove that for every $n ≥ 1$, $G_n ≤ 3^n$.

I used $G_1$ as my base case, since it’s given. 

My induction hypothesis is to assume $G_n \leq 3^n$ for some arbitrary $n$.
Thus I should prove $G_{n+1}\leq  3^{n+1}$.

Using the given formula I simplified down to $2G_n + 3G_{n-1} ≤ 3^n3$.

I feel like I'm pretty much there, but I just don't see how to solidify the proof from here. Any hints would be greatly appreciated!
\section{My Solution}
$$G_1 = 1$$

$$G_2 = 1$$

$$G_n = 2G_{n−1} + 3G_{n−2}, n \geq 3$$

"My induction hypothesis is to assume $G_n \leq 3^n$ for some arbitrary $n$.
Thus I should prove $G_{n+1}\leq  3^{n+1}$.

Using the given formula I simplified down to $2G_n + 3G_{n-1} ≤ 3^n * 3$."

Now, notice this means $$G_{n+1} = 2G_{n} + 3G_{n−1}\leq3^n*3=3^{n+1}$$ You have your desired result.
