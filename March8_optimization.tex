Title : If $x_0$ minimizes $f^2$, $x_0$ minimizes $f$.

I feel that this statement is true, but I am not convinced. Is there a simple counterexample or how might this statement be formalized to make it true?
\section{My Solution}
There are a lot of counter examples..

Take $f=\sin(x)$, it is obvious the statement does not hold. Since $f^2$ is positive, it is minimized when $\sin(x)=0$, but minimal value of $\sin(x)$ is actually $-1$. So the values that minimize $\sin^2(x)$ can never minimize $\sin(x)$.
