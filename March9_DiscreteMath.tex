Title : I am having trouble understanding how to prove that the sum of the first $n$ positive even integers is $n^2 + n$ using strong induction.

> Show the sum of the first $n$ positive even integers is $n^2 + n$ using strong induction.

I can't solve the above problem using strong induction. It will be very helpful if I can get the solution. Thanks in advance.
\section{My Solution}
Basic case is trivially true.

Now assume the sum of the first k positive even integers is $k^2+k$ for all values $1,2,...k_0$

Then we know that the $(k_0+1)^{th}$ even integer is $2k_0+2$, summing that with the first $k_0$ positive even integers yields $k_0^2+3k_0+2=(k_0+1)^2+(k_0+1)$

By the principles of strong induction, the formula is correct. However, strong induction is not necessary in this case as you can easily derive this formula with a summation.
