OP:
This was a bonus question on our last test. I'm not sure how begin. Would it be correct to say that since $|r-1|>0$, $0<r-1<2$? 

The question is as follows:

>Prove that if r is a real number such that $|r-1|<1$, then $\frac4{r(4-r)}\ge1$.

Any suggestions or help explaining what approach I should use would be appreciated.

Answer:
You are trying to prove $$r(4-r)-4<=0$$ which is $$r^2-4r+4>=0$$ then is equivalent to $${(r-2)}^2>=0$$ Is this clear enough?

Btw, of course, r cannot equal to 0 or 4 from the original question.
