Title : Difference between two dates in math formula

Good evening guys, I have little problem, I have to calculate how many days do I have between two dates which contains specific day, month and even year, do you guys have any idea how should I do that? Is there any formula, every formula was containing only month and year but not day... 

By the way I dont know which tag should I give....
\section{My Solution}
For the Gregorian Calender:

1 common year = 365 days

One calendar leap year has 366 days:



Leap year occures every 4 years, except for years that are divisable by 100 and not divisable by 400.

Using this, you should be able to compute the number of days between two dates. Of course,  you can use this to get a formula:

Given date1 = $(d1, m1, y1)$ and date2 = $(d2, m2, y2)$. Let date 2 be the later date. Then the number of days = $\sum(365n1+366n2$ $+(d2-d1)$+$d(\delta m))$. Where $n1$ and $n2$ are the number of normal years and leap years between the two dates and $d(\delta m)$ gives the difference in days caused by the difference in months, which could vary depending on the year and month.
